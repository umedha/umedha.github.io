Over the last decade the methodological literature addressing the challenges in causally identifying contagion in networks has exploded. In one of the foundational works in this literature, Shalizi and Thomas (2011) propose a permutation test for contagion in longitudinal network data that is not confounded by selection (e.g., homophily). We illustrate the properties of this test via simulation. We assess its statistical power under various conditions of the data; including the nature of the contagion, the structure of the network through which contagion occurs, and the number of time periods included in the data. We then apply this test to an example domain that is commonly considered in the context of observational research on contagion—the international spread of democracy. We find evidence of the international contagion of democracy. We conclude with a discussion of the practical applicability of the Shalizi \u0026 Thomas test to the study of contagion in political networks.","tags":["Social Networks","Contagion","Homophily","Diffusion","DAG"],"title":"Contagion, Confounding, and Causality: Confronting the Three C’s of Observational Political Networks Research","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"After many years with a hand written website in HTML, I moved to using the Hugo framework with the Academic theme. The motivation for this is the work of Qingyuan Zhao who deserved the credit for both creating the template and also publishing it so that others can benefit from it. Thank you, Qingyuan Zhao!\nThe Hugo framework with the Academic theme Based on Qingyuan\u0026rsquo;s work, I decided to use Hugo as it is an efficient language expressing the best aspects of markdown. The Academic theme for Hugo is well suited for the websites of academic researchers.\nIt helps to have Hugo installed locally as you can compile the website and see what you will get. Installing Hugo in Mac OS X is straightforward with homebrew. Simply run\nbrew install hugo Creating a local website First, clone my repository or Qingyuan\u0026rsquo;s. I put mine in \u0026ldquo;handcock.github.io\u0026rdquo;. Then rename it to \u0026lt;git hub ID\u0026gt;.github.io\nYou can preview the website by running\nhugo server --baseURL http://localhost:1313/ from the website directory (e.g., \u0026ldquo;handcock.github.io\u0026rdquo;). This builds the website and creates a local web server to host it. It generates a link (the default is http://localhost:1313/) which can be pasted into a web browser. In the background, the hugo server also detects any change to the content and updates the website automatically.\nMaking it your website The files are all writen as text files in markdown. The content sub-folder contains all the Markdown files for website content.\n├── content │ ├── authors │ ├── featured │ ├── group │ ├── home │ ├── post │ ├── project │ ├── publication │ ├── research │ ├── talk │ └── teaching Most of its sub-directories correspond to a section of my webpage (take a look at it); in particular, home corresponds to the homepage of your website. Another unique folder is the authors, which contains basic information about the website owner and all other authors (not needed for a personal website). The publication corresponds to each of my publications.\nBasically, you will edit the text files in each of these sub-directiries to change them to ones that are for you (as now they are all for me!).\nSee its documentation for more information.\nCreating a public website Commit your website as a repository on github (with \u0026lt;git hub ID\u0026gt;.github.io as a name).\nAfter successfully committed, go to your repository and click on the “Settings” on the top right, then scroll down to the Github Pages section. Then click on the published link.\n","date":1650412800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650412800,"objectID":"ee42c466b30f21ae7250698f994671a9","permalink":"https://umedha.github.io/post/migrating/","publishdate":"2022-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/migrating/","section":"post","summary":"After many years with a hand written website in HTML, I moved to using the Hugo framework with the Academic theme.

Point processes on linear networks can simply be defined as point events occurring on or near line segment network structures embedded in a certain space. A separable modeling framework is introduced that posits separate formation and dissolution models of point processes on linear networks over time. While the model was inspired by spider web building activity in brick mortar lines, the focus is on modeling wildfire ignition origins near road networks over a span of 14 years. As most wildfires in California have human-related origins, modeling the origin locations with respect to the road network provides insight into how human, vehicular and structural densities affect ignition occurrence. Model results show that roads that traverse different types of regions such as residential, interface and wildland regions have higher ignition intensities compared to roads that only exist in each of the mentioned region types.","tags":["Point processes","linear network","spatiotemporal modeling","pseudolikelihood","Berman–Turner method","spider webs","wildfires","ignition origins","road networks"],"title":"Modeling wildfire ignition origins in southern California using linear network point processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Medha Uppala","Mark S Handcock"],"categories":[],"content":"This is work I did for the Energy Atlas group at UCLA, modeling parcel-level energy consumption data for the Westwood area.
