This is work I did for the [Energy Atlas](https://www.energyatlas.ucla.edu) group at UCLA, modeling parcel-level energy consumption data for the Westwood area. I fit a Penalized Fixed Effects Quantile Regression model to parcel level energy consumption data to identify contextual outliers. The slides provide a general overview. Chapter 4 in my dissertation provides details on the data and the model.
