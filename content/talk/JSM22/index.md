summary: "This is an paper talk for the session 'Frequentist and Bayesian Inference for Complex Social Data', 2022 Joint Statistical Meetings."

abstract: "As farmers share information on practical agricultural techniques with each other, we want to understandwhat demographic and social network factors lead to greater information sharing and adoption.The goal of this research is to understand and estimate how eâ€€ciently information on disease management behaviors (DMB) spreads in smallholder farmer networks. In this research, we are concerned with DMBs with respect to plant and crop disease. More formally, the goal is to causally estimate the network spillover effects of specific DMBs in smallholder farmer networks in Western Kenya. We intend to achieve this goal through a cluster randomized trial. Methods employed include re-randomization during the design phase, randomization tests to detect interference and estimating direct and indirect effect size via exposure networks."
